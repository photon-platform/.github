**PHOTON** is the compendium of tools, scripts and configurations files for me, `phi ARCHITECT`_, to assist me in accomplishing my goals.

It's essentially the workshop that I have been refining over the years on my journey with Linux.

At the heart is the `.photon`_ - containing core configurations and instantiation tools. Followed by `.vim`_ - configurations for the Vim editor.

A few years ago, I shifted my R&D projects to Python. Which naturally led to developing a set of tools for managing that work. Here are just a few. 

- `progenitor`_: instantiates python projects
- `modulator`_: shapes python modules and packages.
- `sphinxilator`_: crafts multimedia
- `formulator`_: constructs cli forms from yaml blueprints
- `curator`_: maintains project archives
- `logger`_: logs project information

each of these components will fit into the larger picture of the `CLERK`_, an intelligent assistant in line with the vision established by Douglas Engelbart in his 1962 paper, `Augmenting Human Intellect <https://dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906-Framework.html>`_


Led by `phi ARCHITECT`_, the **PHOTON platform** is one of three organizations under their management, the others being `GEOMETOR`_ and `HARMONIC resonance`_. We're not here to sell a product; instead, we're offering an invitation to explore what can be achieved when dedication meets innovation. 

Visit our `PHOTON platform website`_ to further illuminate your path to mastering Python and Linux OS, and to redefine the joy of crafting knowledge.
