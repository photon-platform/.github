Illuminate Your Work: Gather, Process, Publish with PHOTON
----------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the **PHOTON platform**, it is the compendium of tools, scripts and dot files for `phi ARCHITECT`_

This is essentially the workshop that I have been refining over the years on my journey with Linux.

In our `.photon`_ and `.vim`_ repositories, discover PHOTON's dotfiles, provisioning scripts, vim configurations, and plugins.

- `progenitor`_: instantiates python projects
- `modulator`_: shapes python modules and packages.
- `sphinxilator`_: crafts multimedia
- `formulator`_: constructs cli forms from yaml blueprints
- `curator`_: maintains project archives
- `logger`_: logs project information

each of these components will fit into the larger picture of the `CLERK`_, an intelligent assistant in line with the vision established by Douglas Engelbart in his 1962 paper, "Augmenting Human Intellect"


Led by `phi ARCHITECT`_, the **PHOTON platform** is one of three organizations under their management, the others being `GEOMETOR`_ and `HARMONIC resonance`_. We're not here to sell a product; instead, we're offering an invitation to explore what can be achieved when dedication meets innovation. 

Visit our `PHOTON platform website`_ to further illuminate your path to mastering Python and Linux OS, and to redefine the joy of crafting knowledge.
