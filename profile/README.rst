Harness the Power of PHOTON: Gather, Process, Publish
-----------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the **PHOTON platform** â€” a curated collection of Python tools,
optimized for `Pop!_OS`_, designed to transform the way you gather, process,
and publish knowledge on the Linux OS.

In the PHOTON platform, each tool performs a distinct role:

- `Progenitor`_: Giving birth to Python projects.
- `Modulator`_: Creating, managing, and publishing Python modules and packages.
- `Projector`_: Managing project documentation.
- `Executor`_: Managing to-dos for efficiency.
- `Formulator`_: Building blueprint driven dialogs on Textual.
- `Curator`_: Handling git/archive management.
- `Condensor`_: Summarizing content at a URL with AI assistance.
- `Memorator`_: Recording important facts in a project as they occur.

Beyond these tools, PHOTON presents:

- `CLERK`_: The ultimate command-line commander. All the above tools are roles
  under CLERK's management, offering situational awareness and context-based
  commands for your current workspace.  
- `ChatExtractor`_: Parsing and organizing OpenAI chat histories.

Explore our `.photon`_ and `.vim`_ repositories for PHOTON's dotfiles,
provisioning scripts, vim configuration, and plugins.

The **PHOTON platform**, led by `phi ARCHITECT`_, is here to redefine the
efficiency and ease of gathering, processing, and publishing knowledge on
Python and Linux OS.
