Illuminate Your Work: Gather, Process, Publish with PHOTON
----------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the **PHOTON platform**, a testament to the potential of open-source software and Python's versatility. Each tool within the platform is an encapsulation of knowledge and refined workflows, crafted with care to help you shine light on your work.

Guided by our mission to *establish a system architecture to gather, process, and publish living digital archives*, we offer:

- `Progenitor`_: Sparking life into Python projects.
- `Modulator`_: Shaping Python modules and packages.
- `Projector`_: Illuminating project documentation.
- `Executor`_: Structuring to-dos for efficiency.
- `Formulator`_: Blueprinting dialogs on Textual.
- `Curator`_: Organizing git/archive management.
- `Condensor`_: Summarizing content with AI assistance.
- `Memorator`_: Preserving project milestones.

Beyond these tools, we present:

- `CLERK`_: The ultimate command-line commander. CLERK directs the tools above, providing situational awareness and context-based commands.
- `ChatExtractor`_: Parsing and organizing OpenAI chat histories.

In our `.photon`_ and `.vim`_ repositories, discover PHOTON's dotfiles, provisioning scripts, vim configurations, and plugins.

Led by `phi ARCHITECT`_, the **PHOTON platform** is one of three organizations under their management, the others being `GEOMETOR`_ and `HARMONIC resonance`_. We're not here to sell a product; instead, we're offering an invitation to explore what can be achieved when dedication meets innovation. 

Visit our `PHOTON platform website`_ to further illuminate your path to mastering Python and Linux OS, and to redefine the joy of crafting knowledge.
