**PHOTON** is the compendium of tools, scripts and configurations files for me, `phi ARCHITECT`_.

It's a workshop that I have been refining over the years on my journey with Linux, to assist me in accomplishing my goals.

At the heart is `.photon`_ - containing core configurations and instantiation tools. Followed by `.vim`_ - configurations for the Vim editor.

A few years ago, I shifted my R&D projects to Python. Which naturally led to developing a set of tools for managing that work. Here are just a few:

- `progenitor`_: instantiates python projects
- `modulator`_: shapes python modules and packages.
- `sphinxilator`_: tools and themes for publishing with Sphinx
- `formulator`_: constructs cli forms from yaml blueprints
- `curator`_: maintains project archives
- `logger`_: logs project information

each of these components will fit into the larger picture of the `CLERK`_, an intelligent assistant in line with the vision established by Douglas Engelbart in his 1962 paper, `Augmenting Human Intellect <https://dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906-Framework.html>`_. I see the `Textual`_ platform as critical unifying element for the user experience as well as voice interaction.

**PHOTON platform** is one of three organizations of  `phi ARCHITECT`_, along with `GEOMETOR`_ and `HARMONIC resonance`_.
